      <h2>Early Years (1902-1943)</h2>

      <p>Real Madrid's origins begin when football was introduced in Madrid through academics of the Institución Libre de Enseñanza. The group which included several Oxford and Cambridge graduates, founded Sky Football in 1897. Playing their games every Sunday morning in Moncloa.</p>

      <p>In 1900 after a fallout occurred between the members, some of them left to start a new club called New Society of Football. Some of these members included Júlian Palacios, Juan Padrós, and Carlos Padrós, all of whom would later go on to serve as president for Real Madrid. This new club would later be re-named as Madrid Football Club in 1901.</p>

      <p>The foundation of this club wouldn't become official until 6 March 1902. Madrid FC went on to win their first trophy in 1905, defeating Athletic Bilbao in the Spanish Cup final. In 1909 the club was one of the founding fathers for the Royal Spanish Football Federation.</p>

      <p>Early success lead King Alfonso XIII to grant the title of Real to the club in 1920. However, Madrid FC lost the title and the royal crown on its emblem around 1931 after the arrival of the Second Spanish Republic. It wasn't until the end of the Civil War that Madrid regained its royal entity.</p>

      <p>Real Madrid won their first League title in the 1931/32 edition of the Spanish Football League. More so, they managed to defend thier title in the subsequent season.</p>

      <h2>Santiago Bernabéu and European Success (1943-1978)</h2>

      <p>The great Santiago Bernabéu was elected Real Madrid president in 1943. During his tenure he rebuilt the club's stadium and training facilites from damges that were sustained because of the Civil War. In 1953, he began to implemt a strategy of pursuing world-class players, with club Legend Alfredo Di Stéfano being one of those signings.</p>

      <p>Acting on an idea by a French journalist, Bernabéu along with several colleagues decided to create a tournament solely for the champion teams of Europe's domestic leagues; the tournament is known today as the UEFA Champions League. Under his tenure, Real Madrid established themselves as powerhouse in both Spanish and European football. Winning the European Cup a record five times in a row from 1956-1960.</p>

      <p>Los Blancos played the finals three more times after that, being runner-ups in 1962 and 1964, before lifting the trophy for a sixth-time in 1966. Future success would not come until the 70s, where Real Madrid managed to hoist five league championships and three Spanish Cups.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately, the great Santiago Bernabéu died on 2 July 1978. At the same time in which the World Cup was being played in Argentina. FIFA ordered the competition to be stopped for three days in order to morn his loss.</p>

      <p>A year later, Real Madrid launched the first edition of the Santiago Bernabéu Trophy to honour the memory of their former president.</p>

      <h2>The Vulture's Cohort and success thereafter (1980-2000)</h2>

      <p>The early 1980s weren't so kind to Real Madrid as they lost sight of their domestic dominance. Forcing them to turn to their youth academy for home-grown stars that would help the club find its rightful place on the Spanish throne. A Spanish sports journalist named this group players, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Quinta_del_Buitre">The Vulture's Cohort.</a></p>

      <p>The Vulture's Cohort consisted of Emilio Butrageño, Manolo Sanchis, Martín Vázquez, Michel and Miguel Pardeza; all Real Madrid Academy graduates. This core group of players along with other important figures such as Francisco Buyo and Hugo Sánchez, helped restore the club's success. By the end of the 80s Madrid was back to being one of the best teams in Spain and Europe, winning two UEFA Cups, five Spanish League championships, three Spanish Super Cups and one Spanish Cup.</p>

      <p>However, it wasn't until the late 1990s when Real Madrid finally managed to end their 32-year wait for their seventh European Cup; beating Juventus in the 1998 final. Under the charge of Vicente del Bosque, Los Blancos would beat Valencia 3-0 in the 2000 Champions League final, increasing their tournament tally mark to eight. This victory was the beginning of another very successful period in the club's history.</p>

      <h2>Florentino Pérez era (2000-2006)</h2>

      <p>In 2000, Real Madrid found themselves in a financial crisis, with a $302 million debt. Newly elected president, Florentino Pérez, vowed to erase the deficit while also modernizing the club's facilities. His main purpose was to restock the team with A-list stars; a strategy first adopted by Santiago Bernabéu.</p>

      <p>His plan got off to a flying start with the acquisition of Luis Figo from arch-rivals Barcelona. Furthermore, the arrivals of Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo, David Beckham, and Fabio Cannavaro, would go on to form the team everyone knows today as Los Galacticos. This team went on to win the 2002 Champions League, followed by a league title in 2003; considered to many as a not so succesful team.</p>

      <p>This debatable trajectory led Florentino Pérez to rehaul the team starting with the dismissal of Head Coach Vicente del Bosque. An initiative which started a domino effect as twelve players went for the exits. A tough decision that saw the club not win a major trophy for the forseable future.</p>

      <p>Even though there seemed to be some light as at the start of the 2005/06 season with the signings of Júlio Baptista, Robinho, and Sergio Ramos, Real Madrid continued to struggle. That season Madrid were humiliated at home by Barcelona, eliminated from the Copa del Rey by Real Zaragoza after a disastrous 6-1 loss in the fist leg, and an early exit from the Champions League for the fourth consecutive year. FLorentino Pérez had no other option but to reign from his role as president.</p>

      <h2>Ramón Calderón (2006-2009)</h2>

      <p>Ramón Calderón was chosen to assume the presidency at Real Madrid on 2 July 2006. His first action was to rehire Fabio Capello as the club's head coach; his first tenure came in the 1996/97 season.</p>

      <p>The only succes the club would have during the Calderón era was in his first season (2006/07) in charge. Where Madrid won the league title, ending a four-year drought.</p>

      <h2>Florentino Pérez back again (2009-presnt)</h2>

      <p>Florentino Pérez began his second term as Real Madrid president on 1 June 2009. His first order of business was the continuance of the Galacticos policy; the best players on the planet playing for the best club. He broke the transfer record twice that summer with the signings of Kaká and Cristiano Ronaldo.</p>

      <p>During this period the Real Madrid colors has been defended by some of greatest coaches and players in the football world. Mourinho, Carlo Ancelotti, Zidane, Modrić, Özil, Bale, Benzema, Xabi Alonso, and Di Maria are just a few to pass through the Club's ranks.</p>

      <p>Even though, Real Madrid did not have the success that Pérez would have wanted early in his second tenure, his plan would soo begin to take shape. In the 2013/14 season, with Ancelotti at the wheel, Los Blancos would win their long desired tenth UEFA Champions League trophy. Defeating city rivals Atlético Madrid in a 4-1 thriller.</p>

      <p>La Décima was a breath of fresh air and would be the start of a domino effect for immediate future success. Starting in the 2015/16 season, under manager Zinedine Zidane, Real Madrid would begin their journey towards three consecutive UEFA Champions League titles. With Atlético Madrid becoming the first victims by the way of a penalty shoot-out.</p>

      <p>Juventus would be the next team to fall via a 4-1 humiliation on 3 June 2017. This result meant that Real Madrid were the first team to successfully defend their title in the UEFA Champions League era. Finally, Liverpool was the last team to suffer Madrid's European dominace a year later in Kyiv, Ukraine.</p>

      <p>Champions League success wasn't everything that Real Madrid has accomplished during Florentino Pérez's second teneure. They were also able to conquer titles both domestically and beyond European borders. The count currently stands at: four Champions League, four FIFA Club World Cups, three European Super Cups, three La Liga's, two Copa's del Rey, and four Spanish Super Cups.</p>
