    <h2>The Greatest Club in the World</h2>

    <p>For as long as I can remember, fútbol has meant everything to me. When I first got my feet on the ball it was like love at first sight. The type of relationship that can only be seen in Hollywood movies; Disney movies too, it just depends how old you are.</p>

    <p>I was very fortunate enough to realize my first great dream, play fútbol professionally. A desire that came after watching Real Madrid defeat their biggest rival Barcelona in <a href="https://www.goal.com/en-us/news/what-is-el-clasico-real-madrid-vs-barcelona-nickname/g5r0hzooqgna1pdwvqb6498ie">El Clasico</a> all the way back in 2006. It was then where I told my dad that I wanted to play that not only did I wanted to play at the highest level, my goal was to be amongst the best.</p>

    <p>From that point forward, I worked like no other to one day make my dream a reality. At the same time I was also keeping up with the action over at Real Madrid, who so happened to become my favorite team that one afternoon. My intentions were to match everything the club was doing on and off the pitch.</p>

    <p>If they were signing the best players, I was searching up their highlights to adapt my game to theirs. When they sold a player, there highlight real became my journal. What did they do so wrong that Real Madrid decided to let them go?</p>

    <p>My affinity for them grew to the point were I felt a part of the team even though I was just watching them on the television. When they were winning, I celebrated the victory like no other; when they were going through hard times, I was there every step of the way waiting patiently for the bounce back. Fútbol is a way of life that cannot be explained, it has to be lived in order to be understood.</p>

    <p>In this world, once you select a team to support you are to be by their side for the rest of your life. We are more than likely to be more loyal to our club than we will ever be to our own partners.</p>

    <p>This sport and this club has taught me everything I know about life. From my friends turned family, to traveling the world, getting to know many different cultures, is all due to my faithful support to Real Madrid play every weekend. Even though I never got to live out my biggest dream, my desire to be the best in whatever area of life is because that little kids dream of being the best ever is still very much alive.</p>

    <p>Only fútbol die hards will truly understand my affection towards my club. So, if you want to know why Real Madrid are the best in the history of the game, you'll just have to scroll through the pages above. Hopefully then you too will become a part of the royal family.</p>
